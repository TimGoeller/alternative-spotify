This project requires font-awesome-pro! 

This experimental Spotify-Player was built using Vue.js, and allows for user authentication on the client-side. There is no logic to automatically refresh the token once it expires yet. 

Due to limitations regarding fetching the Spotify queue, it's unfortunately not possible to display more than the next 2 upcoming songs.
